# NPL words similarity project based on Polish Wikipedia random texts

For this project I have used Polish Wikipedia random texts to create an aplication that can find similar words. 
From these texts I have deleted polish and english stopwords, every dots, comas and special symbols using regular expressions module.
Than every single quote I splited into lists of single words and saved them into an array.
Finaly I learned an algorithm the ability to find similar words.
For example, if you search "green" you will recive list with similar words like: orange, blue, dark-green, leaf, tree...
